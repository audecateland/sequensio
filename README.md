<h1> Sequensio web app ðŸ“š</h1>
<br>
Sequensio is a playlist generator app for music enthusiasts who wants to use perfect playlist to match their activities. 
You can easily create a playlist of several sequences according to your own criterias. This app is accesible while connecting to your spotify account so that you can access to your music library to create your playlist in seconds.

This app has been developed during Le Wagon's Bootcamp in two weeks by a team of 4 developers including me. We pitched it during the DemoDay (last day of the bootcamp) in front of external people.

You can open the app in production here: https://www.sequensio.me (Best to see it on an iPhone or with a mobile simulator on a computer as the style for larger screens has not been totally implemented).

Please note that this app is submitted to Spotify dev freemium limitation of restricted user before our project gets further approval. Please contact us if you'd like to be granted access.
